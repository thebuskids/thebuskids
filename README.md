## Hi there 👋

I'm a current **Data Science Master's student** in NYC and **Orchestral Musician**. I'm passionate about the intersection of data, behavior, and audio, using machine learning to solve challenges in the audio and entertainment space - specifically how Music Information Retrieval (MIR) can improve personalization and discovery. I use this space to document my projects, experiments, and my journey through advanced analytics.
